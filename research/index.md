Our lab engineers programmable biomaterials and biointerfaces by connecting **molecular design** to **measurable function** across length scales. Below are representative themes—edit them to match your lab.

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 1 — Programmable biomaterials (sequence → structure → function)</strong>
  <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 0;">
    Briefly describe your core design strategy. What knobs do you tune (sequence, chemistry, architecture)?
    What properties do you program (mechanics, assembly, stability, bioactivity)?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example direction A (1 sentence)</li>
    <li>Example direction B (1 sentence)</li>
    <li>Example direction C (1 sentence)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 2 — Biointerfaces & functional devices</strong>
  <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 0;">
    Describe the platforms you build (micro/nanofabrication, microneedles, microfluidics, coatings, sensors, etc.)
    and what they enable (delivery, sampling, monitoring, actuation).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example platform A (1 sentence)</li>
    <li>Example platform B (1 sentence)</li>
    <li>Example application C (1 sentence)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 3 — Data-driven design rules</strong>
  <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 0;">
    Explain what data you generate, how you ensure quality/standardization, and how you use models to guide design.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dataset type A (what + why)</li>
    <li>Modeling/ML approach B (what decision it supports)</li>
    <li>Validation strategy C (how you close the loop)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Facilities & collaboration
Add a short paragraph about core facilities you use (imaging, microfabrication, proteomics, computing) and
the kinds of collaborators you’re excited to work with.

We engineer programmable biomaterials for biointerfaces by integrating **biomanufacturing**, **proteins/biomaterials engineering**, and **micro/nanoscale fabrication**. Our work aims to uncover **design rules** that connect molecular composition to multiscale function, enabling new capabilities in healthcare and sustainable systems.

  <strong>Theme 1 — Programmable biomaterials (sequence - structure - property - function)</strong>
  <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 0;">
    Proteins (e.g., silk fibroin, spidroin) hold great promise as versatile biomaterials due to their unique chemistry and structural diversity. Yet our ability to rationally design and produce high-performance, programmable proteins with tunable and expanded chemistries remains limited. Top-down material processing approaches inevitably introduce heterogeneity, while bottom-up strategies such as chemical synthesis and conventional biomanufacturing have struggled to produce proteins with diverse chemical functionalities beyond the 20 standard amino acids at scale. These constraints also impede systematic mapping of sequence-structure-property-function relationships and translation to real-world biomaterial applications. To address these gaps, I will use genomically recoded organisms (GROs) as production chassis. By replacing or removing reassigned codons genome-wide, GROs eliminate endogenous competition present in conventional hosts, enabling site-specific incorporation of nsAAs. Building on their use in biological studies, I will repurpose GROs for scalable biomaterial production, pursuing three objectives:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop genomic, biomolecular, and proteomic tools to enable scalable biomanufacturing of chemically diverse, homogeneous proteins in GROs</li>
    <li>Investigate sequence-structure-property-function relationships in expanded chemistry space experimentally and computationally</li>
    <li>Design and produce proteins with programmable properties tailored for advanced biomaterial applications in precision agriculture and healthcare</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0 0;"><small>Theme 1 pipeline. Phase 0: establish the GRO/OTS platform for multi-site, high-fidelity
nsAA incorporation. Design: in-silico sequence design with molecular dynamics to position nsAAs (X). Biomanufacturing: express target proteins in GROs. Characterization: structure, morphology, and functional assays. Data close a model-build-test-learn loop to derive sequence-structure-property-function maps and programmable biomaterial properties.</small></p>

  <strong>Theme 2 — Biointerfaces & functional devices</strong>
  <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 0;">
    Describe the platforms you build (micro/nanofabrication, microneedles, microfluidics, coatings, sensors, etc.)
    and what they enable (delivery, sampling, monitoring, actuation).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example platform A (1 sentence)</li>
    <li>Example platform B (1 sentence)</li>
    <li>Example application C (1 sentence)</li>
  </ul>

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 3 — Engineered living materials</strong>
  <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 0;">
    Explain what data you generate, how you ensure quality/standardization, and how you use models to guide design.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dataset type A (what + why)</li>
    <li>Modeling/ML approach B (what decision it supports)</li>
    <li>Validation strategy C (how you close the loop)</li>
  </ul>

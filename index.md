## What we do
We engineer programmable biomaterials and biointerfaces by integrating **biomanufacturing**, **proteins/biomaterials engineering**, and **micro/nanoscale fabrication**. Our work aims to uncover **design rules** that connect molecular composition to multiscale function, enabling new capabilities in healthcare and sustainable systems.

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 1 — Programmable biomaterials</strong><br/>
  <span class="muted"> Engineering chemically diverse proteins using genomically recoded organisms to systematically unravel sequence-to-function relationships in expanded chemistry space and enable programmable biomaterial properties.</span>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 2 — Biointerfaces & functional devices</strong><br/>
  <span class="muted"> Manufacturing functional biomaterials and devices through advanced micro/nanofabrication techniques for precise delivery and sensing, and to establish process-structure-function relationships.</span>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <strong>Theme 3 — Engineered living materials</strong><br/>
  <span class="muted"> Elucidating and modulating biomaterial-living system interactions at their interfaces to control biological responses and generating sequence-structure-property-response rules for engineered living materials.</span>

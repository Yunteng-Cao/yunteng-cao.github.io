## What we do
We engineer programmable biomaterials for biointerfaces by integrating **biomanufacturing**, **proteins/biomaterials engineering**, and **micro/nanoscale fabrication**. Our work aims to uncover **design rules** that connect molecular composition to multiscale function, enabling new capabilities in healthcare and sustainable systems.

## Recent highlights
-- Our research on **[Nanofabrication of silk microneedles for high throughput micronutrients delivery and continuous sap monitoring in plants](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01923-2)** has been published in *Nature Nanotechnology*!  
  It is also the cover story of [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu) ([link](https://news.mit.edu/2025/will-vegetables-future-be-fortified-using-tiny-needles-0429)).

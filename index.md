## What we do
We engineer programmable biomaterials and biointerfaces by integrating **biomanufacturing**, **protein engineering**, and **micro/nanomanufacturing**. Our work aims to uncover **design rules** that connect molecular composition to multiscale function, enabling new capabilities in healthcare and sustainable systems.
